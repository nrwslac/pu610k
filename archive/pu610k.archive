# List of PVs to archive with timing in seconds between readings and 
# optionally "monitor".
#
# The difference is without "monitor", you will always record at the 
# specified rate, but with, you will try to get every change, perhaps
# more, perhaps less.
#
# Assume $(BASE) is the base PV of the detector and $(IOC) is the IOC PV.
